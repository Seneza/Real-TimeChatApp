# Real-TimeChatApp
Real Time iOS Chat App using firebase

This is an iOS I am working on, building it entirely in Swift. The purpose of this app is to help college students collaborate on real-time homework together. 
I magine a perfect world where you and your classmates can work on an assignment on your mobile phone, without having to worry about the time to meet abd where. 
Simply put, this app will allow users to post an assignment in message, propose times to meet and places, and the members of the homewrok group will vote. 
Using the majority votes, the app will pick the time and place and set it for you automatically.
More and more features will be added later, but the tools I am using include Swift, XCode, github, Firebase backend, Sketch for the designs and more iOS framework APIs.

The readme will be updated as I add more.
